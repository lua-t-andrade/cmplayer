# SIMPLE CLI MP3 PLAYER IMPLEMENTATION IN GO

This was more of an experiment in the Go lang for me.
Uses the beep mp3 decoder!

- https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gopxl/beep#StreamCloser

## Compilation

	go build .
	
## Usage

	mplayer [filename] - play file
    mplayer dir - shows current directory
    mplayer help -- shows this text

That's all!~
